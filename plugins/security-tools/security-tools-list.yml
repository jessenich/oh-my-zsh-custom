    short-description: "Nmap is a free and open source network scanner."
    long-description: |
      Nmap is a utility for network exploration or security auditing. It
      supports ping scanning (determine which hosts are up), many port
      scanning techniques, version detection (determine service protocols
      and application versions listening behind ports), and TCP/IP
      fingerprinting (remote host OS or device identification). Nmap also
      offers flexible target and port specification, decoy/stealth scanning,
      sunRPC scanning, and more. Most Unix and Windows platforms are
      supported in both GUI and command line modes. Several popular handheld
      devices are also supported, including the Sharp Zaurus and the iPAQ.

    long-description: |
      ndiff is a tool for comparing two files or directories. It is similar to
      the standard diff utility, but it is designed to be more efficient for
      large files. It is also more flexible, allowing you to specify the
      files to compare, and to specify the output format.

      scanning process. Yara is a community-driven project, and the
      development of Yara is supported by a community of volunteers.
      Pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers
      YARA is a tool aimed at helping malware researchers to identify and
      classify malware samples. With YARA, it is possible to create
      descriptions of malware families based on textual or binary patterns
      contained in samples of those families. Each description consists of
      a set of strings and a Boolean expression which determines its logic.
      The expression is evaluated by the YARA compiler, which generates a
      Complex and powerful rules can be created by using binary strings with
      wild-cards, case-insensitive text strings, special operators, regular
      expressions and many other features.

    short-description: "Web application vulnerability scanner"
    long-description: |
      Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications.
      It performs "black-box" scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of the
      application but will scan the web pages of the deployed web applications,
      looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data.
      Once it gets this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see
      if a script is vulnerable.
      .
      Wapiti can detect the following vulnerabilities:
        - Database Injection (PHP/ASP/JSP SQL Injections and XPath Injections)
        - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) reflected and permanent
        - File disclosure detection (local and remote include, require, fopen,
          readfile...)
        - Command Execution detection (eval(), system(), passtru()...)
        - XXE (Xml eXternal Entity) injection
        - CRLF Injection
        - Search for potentially dangerous files on the server (thank to the Nikto db)
        - Bypass of weak htaccess configurations
        - Search for copies (backup) of scripts on the server
        - Shellshock
        - DirBuster like
        - Server Side Request Forgery (through use of an external Wapiti website)
